**Solution**: 
- Simplified logic to 40 lines with clean path calculation
- Removed debug code and improved error handling
- Implemented efficient subdirectory detection
```javascript
// Before: Complex path calculation

<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com;">
```
**Result**: Enterprise-level security standards achieved

### **Challenge 3: Performance Optimization**
**Problem**: No lazy loading, causing slow initial page loads
**Impact**: Poor user experience, especially on mobile devices
**Solution**: 
- Implemented intersection observer-based lazy loading
